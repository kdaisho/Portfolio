# Portfolio Website

Portfolio website build on Angular.js

All animations (except SVG inline animation) work on modern browsers.
Animation tested on IE11: Successful. Not sure on IE <= 10


@ Directions:
::Before working, 'gulp clean' is recommended to remove old distribution files in dist/
::To start development, do 'gulp dev'. It handles concatenating js files and sass compilation dynamically.
::Do not directly work on app.js. JavaScript working files are 'jquery.js', 'functions.js' and 'data.js'. Leave 'app.js' alone.
::When ready to deploy, do 'gulp build'. Minified distribution files will be ready in dist/ just for you.

::Watch out! You have to toggle comment for a script tag at the bottom of index.html, if you want to use app.min.js

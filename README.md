# Portfolio Website

Portfolio website build on Angular.js

All animations (except SVG inline animation) work on modern browsers.
Animation tested on IE11: Successful. Not sure on IE <= 10


### Directions:
* Run server 'http-server' for Angular to serve
* Before working, 'gulp clean' is recommended to remove old distribution files in dist/
* To start development, use 'gulp dev'.
* Make sure to rurn on LiveReload Chrome extension. Use Incognito mode or you'll stuck with cached refreshes.
* Do not directly work on app.js. JavaScript working files are 'jquery.js', 'functions.js' and 'data.js'. Leave 'app.js' alone.
* When ready to deploy, do 'gulp build'. Minified distribution files will be ready in dist/ just for you.

# Portfolio Website built in January 2016

This is a portfolio website build on Angular.js.
jQuery handles some interactions but I wrote CSS animation rules for the most of interactions.

All animations (except SVG inline animation) work on modern browsers.
I have tested on IE11: it works well on it. I am not sure it works right on IE10 and below.
